ClojureScript 1.12 Dev Notes

* Clojure 1.12 introduced method values in the following forms
** `Classname/staticMethod` - existing static method descriptor
** `Classname/.instancedMethod` - describes an instance method
** `Classname/new` - describes a constructor
* `Classname/staticMethod`
** ClojureScript does not use JS class syntax to define anything
** "static fields" are just properties on the ctor fn
** However this could easily be detected by the compiler
*** `(set! (.. Foo -prototype BAR) ...)`
**** where `Foo` is a known deftype
** Clojure can disambiguate between method/properties
*** ClojureScript cannot in the general case
**** foreign JS libraries
*** It can work for Closure Compatible stuff
**** due to externs parsing
** Option: Could assume `Classname/staticMethod` fn
*** CLJS doesn't support anything but namespaces before the `/`
**** So minimal breakage likely
* `Classname/.instanceMethod` no precendent so also easy to handle
* `Classname/new` a special case so easy to handle
** Again `non-namespace/foo` never worked before
* Other considerations
** `^:param-tags`
*** Don't immediately see a use for this
**** We don't have the method selection problem
** `goog.foo.Bar`
*** Users do sometimes depend on global access to Closure libs
*** externs parsing can let us know if `/` should be allowed or not
** js$foo.bar
*** A proposed enhancement to use global libraries as namespaces
*** `js$foo.bar.Baz/staticMethod` when `js$foo.bar` not required
**** it's not a great pattern to encourage
***** macros are a case where it can be useful
****** i.e. macro depends on a require that the user didn't provide
****** combining w/ js$ though seems gratuitous
***** that said, argument for consistency
****** and no need to prioritize library writers
****** convenient for solo developers on their blog etc.
** if something is `:refer`ed etc.
*** Can easily support `/`
** `js/foo/bar`
*** Not supported
