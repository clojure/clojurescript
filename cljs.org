* ClojureScript
* Rationale
** What
*** Compiler that compiles (a subset of?) Clojure to Javascript
** Why?
*** Because js is the only universally available client target
**** and can't be supplanted due to its browser integration and installed base
**** yet isn't very good, expressive, concise, or robust
**** but JS engines continue to get lots of optimization love, and are now quite capable perf-wise
*** Use same skillset and libs for client and server
**** only other similar options are:
***** JS native client, JS (e.g. node) server
****** node still much less powerful than JVM, and might be a mere fad
***** Java (GWT) client, Java native server
****** GWT has lots of baggage due to semantic mismatches etc
****** but familiar tooling if already a Java dev
***** esoteric, open question as to skills and libs:
****** [[http://clamato.net/][Clamato Smalltalk]]
****** [[http://www.wescheme.org/][Moby Scheme]]
*** Clojure semantics can fit well on JS
**** i.e. defn/type/protocol won't fight with js core model
*** ClojureJS arguably becomes most powerful lang on client
**** Robust, simple Clojure model
**** Macros etc
*** Might be best way to run Clojure on mobile
*** js a possible path to delivering Clojure libs to C-linkage clients
**** via embedded Google V8 js engine
**** somewhat speculative, but considering for M
**** V8 wrappers exist for Python, Ruby, PHP etc
** How?
*** Compiler written in Clojure, generates (readable?) JS
*** Optionally run that JS through Google Closure js->js compiler
**** for minification, dead code elimination etc
*** Use Google Closure js library where needed for implementation support
**** e.g. goog.math has Long arithmetic
**** module system
**** use gclosure annotations for stronger type checking or better code gen?
**** dependency system
*** Macros written in Clojure proper, run by the compiler
**** stick to subset in macros if eval supported
*** Any runtime support written completely in itself
**** make deftype and protocols work early
** Non-objectives
*** complete Clojure
**** feel free to subset, especially at first
**** but try to make anything present in both work identically
*** compiling e.g. core.clj as-is
**** don't want to touch Clojure itself for this
**** bootstrap will differ anyway
** Ancillary benefits
*** Analysis component of compiler might serve Clojure-in-Clojure, or other tooling
**** maybe - we'll need far less analysis support in js than we do in Java
*** Boost for Clojure adoption due to increased reach
*** Power tool for exploring next-gen client approach
* Implementation
** Primitives
*** DONE def
*** fn*
**** DONE basics
**** DONE recur
**** TODO variable arity
**** TODO arity overloading
**** closures shouldn't map directly to js closures? - no, they should
***** they capture entire surrounding environment
****** hearsay, V8 already better
***** premature optimization to avoid that? - yes
***** shouldn't js engines do that for us? - yes
***** try goog.partial? - not for this
**** variable arity how?
***** switch on arguments.length
*** DONE if
**** need to match Clojure semantics (nil/false)
***** must deal with undefined (group with nil/false?)
*** DONE let*
**** must fix local scoping problem
***** nested fns or renaming?
**** let* semantics
*** DONE do
**** as with Java, not an expression
**** doFn(...) -> returns last arg
***** must alloc array for arguments?
*** TODO global
**** use 'var for this
***** already Clojure special op
***** but wrong semantics, (var x) is *ns*-relative
***** no true unqualified globals in Clojure
*** DONE recur
**** to loop
**** to fn head
***** can't do in single pass
*** DONE invoke
*** DONE macros
*** DONE ns
**** (ns my.ns (:require your.ns ...) (:macros a-clojure-ns ...))
***** aliases?
**** =>
***** make a clojure ns? cljs.my.ns?
***** goog.provide('my.ns'); goog.require('your.ns');
***** (
*** DONE deftype*
**** maps to prototype/contructor combo
**** deftype macro is deftype* + extend-type
***** extend-type with ::fields meta on param vectors
*** TODO reify*
**** yes, for one-off protocol impls
**** no ctor created, just put impls on object
***** can share code with putting impls on prototype?
*** DONE defprotocol*
**** not primitive in Clojure proper
**** extend, when given ctor, modifies prototype with slot
***** slot is ns-qualified
***** what about core prototypes - Object, Array et al (String, Number, Boolean, Function)?
****** poor citizenship to modify these?
****** Object different in that it is used as map
****** nested window scope issues?
**** protocol fns just turn (my.ns/foo x a b c) into x["my.ns/foo"](a, b ,c)
***** foo(x, a, b, c)
****** must pass target
***** better - x.my$ns$foo(a, b ,c)
****** can be minified
*** DONE extend-type
*** defrecord?
**** any way to get (:foo x) => x.foo?
***** beware GClojure renaming
*** DONE new
**** what to do? ordinary invoke works fine
***** new could be aliased, not special form then
***** not ordinary - first arg not evaluated
****** but should be in JS since new is an operator on a function, not a name
**** new itself shouldn't be evaluated, won't pass fnOf
**** (my.ns.Blah. x y z) - just macroexpander stuff
**** (Blah. x y z) - requires import and registry
***** class aliases a bigger issue, will there be more conflicts?
***** any interpretation will fit only one ns strategy (e.g. gclosure's, and thus ClojureScript's) 
***** start without this
*** DONE dot
**** field/zero-arg-method distinguished how?
***** not, just support scoped var and be done
*** DONE set! (assign)
**** same binding rules?
***** no
**** or just allow assign to scoped 'vars'?
*** TODO name munging
**** special chars
**** js reserved words
*** TODO (js code-string)
**** with name escaping
*** TODO exceptions
**** throw
**** try
**** catch
***** won't have exception type
**** finally
*** TODO quote
*** vars?
*** case?
*** callable non-function types?
**** seems not possible portably
**** could do with __proto__ (non-standard, all but IE support, even IE9 doesn't)
**** how would Clojure feel without callable collections and keywords?
**** could do with conditional every invocation:
***** (f instanceof Function?f:f.cljs_lang_invoke)(args)
***** but where to put f (in expr context)?
****** needs helper fn
****** fnOf(f)(args)
******* function fnOf(x){return (f instanceof Function?f:f.cljs_lang_invoke);}
****** i.e. every call is 2 calls
******* tracing jit will inline?

** Library
*** persistent data structures?
**** make base literals create JS base literals? (array, object-as-map)
***** seems a big waste not to leverage js optimization of dynamic properties
****** or, that's what deftype is about, maps have always added overhead
***** we care more about accessors than assignment/modification
****** i.e. we will superimpose copy-on-write
***** string/keyword problem
****** can make {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} => {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
****** but (keys that) => ["a" "b" "c"]
****** could use internal array of keys trick
******* keys used as strings in property map
******* kept intact in internal arrays, which is what is returned by keys fn
******* means keys must be string distinct - ick
**** promote only on conj?
***** or on size as well?
** Questions
*** equality and hashing
*** undefined
**** turn into nil?
**** can't catch everywhere
*** vars
**** def should create slots in global ns objects?
**** what var semantics matter?
*** keywords and symbols
**** make separate object types?
***** not many symbols make it into runtime use, but keywords do
**** need to make sure {:key val} and (:key obj) are fast
**** native maps can have only string keys
*** metadata
**** just claim a slot?
*** namespaces
**** tie into gclosure module system?
**** compile-time enumerability?
*** eval
**** runtime compiler?
**** would let you develop in the browser, repl etc
**** means compiler must self-host
***** and needs runtime reader
***** and syntax-quote
**** no macros?
***** can't do without, as so many basic things are macros
**** won't have google closure compiler there
***** ok, shouldn't rely on that
*** laziness
**** not a great fit
**** GC probably not as good
**** unlikely to be working with bigger-than-memory
**** non-lazy mapping/filtering or mapv, filterv
***** can make it back into Clojure
*** Immutability
**** enforced?
***** or just use safe lib fns to avoid
****** lets you use base types
****** no final on which to base it anyway
****** would need fancy encapsulation techniques
******* how fancy?
***** correct (non-assigning) code does the same thing, but incorrect not caught
****** fair compromise?
**** gclosure compiler can do some enforcement
***** given some const hints in comment-based annotations
*** Interactive development
**** REPL
***** easiest:
***** Clojure read -> cljs analyze -> cljs emits -> embedded Rhino eval+print
**** Incompatible constructs
***** for host interop
****** preclude development in Clojure
**** Missing JS things
***** e.g. DOM etc
***** headless JS environment with DOM mocks?
* Namespaces and macros
** Macro problem?
*** syntax quote in the reader uses Clojure namespaces
*** hardwired to Compiler.currentNS().getMapping() Compiler.resolveSymbol(), isSpecial() etc
*** ::keyword resolution uses Compiler.currentNS(), namespaceFor()
*** if it expands to calls to other macros, those need to be in clojure-land
**** maybe - they need to be the cljs-compatible versions
***** argument for calling core clojure.core in cljs too?
****** but we can't have 2 clojure.core namespaces during compilation
***** translate/consider clojure.core/xxx => cljs.core/xxx during cljs compilation?
****** doesn't work if we have separate cljs.macros
******* some core things will be in cljs.core, some in cljs.macros
******* put core macros on cljs/core.clj
******* other core code in cljs/core.cljs
******* both contain ns declarations - ok?
*** but expansions destined for cljs compilation need to be resolved in cljs-land
**** dummy vars in dummy namespaces?
***** no - doesn't cover external nses, cljs aliases
***** just fully qualify everything non-core in macroexpansions
**** different specials set a problem
***** e.g. global, ns, defprotocol* not specials
****** could use var for global
****** could make ns a special?
******* probably not
******* but what macro would emit that?
***** install all cljs specials in dummy nses?
****** no, doesn't help macros file
*** inline defmacro in cljs?
**** calls Clojure eval of defmacro call
**** can expand to calls to enclosing cljs ns
***** but expander can't call code in enclosing cljs ns
***** convention - all macro helper fns are local fns in macro
**** gets icky for load/require purposes, as must be loaded with cljs compiler
***** better to keep public macros separate - can use ordinary Clojure require then
***** local macros would be ok for same-file consumption though
**** convention - portable libs that expose macros package them separately
** Want some equivalent of refer clojure.core
*** else practically everything will be qualified
**** e.g. core/defn - ick
*** but fewer things brought in by default?
**** requires selectivity control, or just a smaller core.cljs?
*** this is equivalent to a 'use', which we otherwise aren't supporting
**** unfair or don't care?
** Any 'use' equivalent (e.g. refer core) means compile-time disambiguation of unqualified references
*** if names a referred thing, that thing, else current.ns.name
**** like current namespaces
**** but if refers are limited to (entirety of) core, just look there first
**** so double lookup instead of copying core vars into name table
** Some core things defined in js
*** where we don't want to otherwise expose things needed for their impl
**** e.g. ==, ===, math ops, instanceOf typeof etc
*** how to reserve names?
**** declare in core.cljs?
*** if in actual .js file, separate ns for deps purposes?
**** i.e. it will be a different file than that produced by compiling core.cljs
**** or just a wad of js injected into core.cljs?
***** include a (js code-string) primitive for this purpose?
****** yes, much better than js files
****** accept only at top level? - no
****** using in local scope means knowing how locals are represented
****** some sort of escaping construct for getting (local and other) names resolved
******* ~{identifier}
** Are we doing forward reference detection here?
*** requires listing of contents of current ns
**** like namespaces
** Are we doing extern-ns name validation?
*** could do for cljs names, but not others
**** e.g. goog.whatever not enumerable in cljs
**** can we discern this situation?
***** probably not, when compiling from files
****** since 'require' doesn't load code at compile time
**** another reason we can't support 'use'
***** we do want to be able to (:require goog.foo)
****** but not a compile-time enumerable ns
***** or especially: (:require [goog.foo :as gfoo])
***** means alias map, like namespaces
** Macros written in separate Clojure files
*** Clojure code, in regular namespaces
*** Means core split into core.cljs, and core-macros.clj
**** both need to be auto-referred
*** if no use/only for macro ns, then can only get as succinct as (alias/macro ...)
**** could allow explicit aliasing of vars instead of use
**** extend alias for this?
***** not really extending, alias will do this due to how nses are just vars
***** but need not be used in that pat of resolution
** goog.provide throws called-twice exception
*** intended to prevent providing the same ns in more than one file
*** actually prevents reloading same file? - aargh
*** can't wrap, since deps checkers look for it at top level
**** will we need to track at compilation-time?
**** will we still need *compile-file* notion?
** Compilation needs
*** current ns
**** *cljs-ns* ?
**** is this a Clojure ns?
***** not a fit
****** map is sym->Var or Class
****** aliases are sym->Namespace
*** ns has:
**** *cljs-namespaces* - {name->ns}
**** {:name "my.ns" :defs {sym qualified.sym} :deps {alias Namepsace-or-qualified.sym}}
**** defs
***** just set of names? no map
***** or map to fully qualified self?
**** deps
***** can't merge macros and cljs ns in deps
****** same ns might map to both
******* i.e. cljs.core will
***** aliases
****** sym->fully-qualified-sym
****** is this a separate mapping vs macros and requires?
******* if not, fn alias can mask out ns alias
******* that can't happen in Clojure
***** macro nses
****** map of sym->Namespaces?
******* require an alias?
******* (:macros {mm my.macros, ym your.macros})
****** aliases for these same as others?
***** required libs must have aliases too?
****** (:require [goog.math.Long :as gml])
****** or new (:require {gml goog.math.Long})
*** lookup 'foo - no ns, no dots
**** if special - done
**** if local - done
**** if found in cljs.macros Namespace, the macro cljs.macros/foo
**** if found in cljs.core ns, cljs.core.foo
**** whatever 'foo maps to in (-> env :ns :requires)
**** no use of deps
*** lookup 'foo.bar.baz - no ns, dot(s)
**** if foo is a local, foo_nnnn.bar.baz
**** if foo has a mapping in (:ns env) - that.mapping.bar.baz - no
***** really? covered by alias/whatever
****** more idiomatic for goog.stuff than goog.stuff/foo
****** but no :as there
***** leave out for now
**** else foo.bar.baz
*** lookup 'foo/bar - ns with no dots
**** get what 'foo maps to in (:ns env) deps
***** if nothing - error "no alias foo"
**** if maps to Namespace, the macro 'bar in that ns
**** else a symbol, e.g. 'fred.ethel => fred.ethel.bar
*** lookup fully.qualified/foo - ns with dots
**** would only use this if local shadowed (and no alias)?
**** what doesn't have alias?
***** cljs.core, cljs.macros
***** could use cljs.core.foo for former
***** always interpret as macro ns?
****** or check deps vals for Namespace, else not
***** if Namespace, the macro foo in Namespace
***** fully.quallified.foo
**** everything might have alias, but macros/syntax-quote need to emit full expansions
*** how to refer to true globals?
**** e.g. Object, String, goog
**** [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects][JS Globals]]
**** (var Name)?
***** that doesn't match Clojure, where (var x) means 'whatever x means in current ns'
***** there are no unqualified globals in Clojure
**** means (extend (var Object) ...) needs to work
***** ok if extend evaluates first arg
***** it does in Clojure, as it is a function
